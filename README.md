# SQLModel Reference

This repository contains personal notes, code examples, and modular patterns for learning and using [**SQLModel**](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) â€” a library that combines the power of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, created by the author of FastAPI.

## Purpose

To understand how SQLModel works in real FastAPI backends by exploring:

* Model definition and table creation
* Sync and async CRUD operations
* Foreign key relationships and joins
* Async integration with FastAPI
* Testing database code

## Structure

Each folder contains focused, minimal examples on a specific concept

## License
